# Cloud Sync

Encrypted synchronization of uniTerm settings through your own private Git repository — no centralized server required, and your data security is fully under your control.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create a Private Repository + Access Token

#### GitHub

**Create a private repository:** Log in to GitHub → Click `+` in the top right → New repository → Enter a repository name → Choose **Private** → Create repository.

**Generate an access token:** Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token:
- Repository access: Choose **Only select repositories** and select the private repository you just created
- Permissions → Contents: Set to **Read and write**
- Copy the token after generation (it is shown only once)

#### GitLab

**Create a private repository:** Log in to GitLab → New project → Create blank project → Enter a project name → Set Visibility Level to **Private** → Create project.

**Generate an access token:** Settings → Access Tokens → Add new token:
- Token name: Enter a name
- Select scopes: Check **api**, or at least check **read_repository** + **write_repository**
- Copy the token after generation (it is shown only once)

#### Gitee

**Create a private repository:** Log in to Gitee → Click `+` in the top right → New Repository → Enter a repository name → Choose **Private** → Create.

**Generate an access token:** Click your avatar in the top right → Settings → Private Tokens → Generate New Token:
- Check **user_info** and **projects** permissions
- Copy the token after generation (it is shown only once)

### 2. Configure uniTerm

1. Open Settings → Cloud Sync and click "Add Repository"
2. Enter the repository URL, username (optional), and access token
3. Set a **master password** (used to encrypt data; it is not uploaded to the repository)
4. Click OK, and uniTerm will automatically complete the initial synchronization

::: warning Note
- Keep your token and master password safe. The token is shown only once
- The repository must be set to private, otherwise synchronized data will be publicly visible
- When syncing across multiple devices, enter the same repository URL, token, and master password on each device

## Sync Operations

### Manual Sync

Click the "Sync Now" button, and uniTerm will automatically compare local and remote differences:
- **Local is newer → Push to remote** (upload)
- **Remote is newer → Pull to local** (download)
- **No differences → Already up to date**

### Auto Sync

When auto-sync is enabled:
- Sync automatically once at **startup**
- Upload automatically after **each modification** to connections, settings, or quick commands

## Sync Contents

The following data is synchronized (encrypted before storage):

- Connection list and groups
- Application settings (including AI model configuration)
- Quick commands

Data that is NOT synchronized:

- Cloud sync configuration itself (configured independently per device)
- Interface layout state
- Terminal history

## Conflict Handling

When multiple devices modify data simultaneously and the latest version is not pulled before pushing, conflicts may occur. uniTerm will show a conflict resolution dialog with two options:

- **Use Local Data** — Use the current device's data as authoritative, overwriting the remote repository
- **Use Remote Data** — Use the remote repository's data as authoritative, overwriting the current device

## Encryption & Security

- **Encryption Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM, using a random nonce for each encryption
- **Key Derivation:** The encryption key is derived from the master password using the PBKDF2-SHA256 algorithm
- **Key Storage:** The derived key is stored in the operating system keychain (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain / Linux keyring)
- **Zero Trust:** All data is encrypted on the client side before uploading. The Git server only sees ciphertext

## Managing Repositories

### Modify Credentials

Click "Edit Repository" to modify the username and access token. The repository URL cannot be modified (you must unbind first and then reconfigure).

When modifying credentials, uniTerm automatically verifies that the new token can access the repository and that the master password can decrypt the remote data.

### Change Master Password

Click "Change Master Password" to change the encryption password. The key is re-derived using the same salt, and all data is re-encrypted and pushed.

### Unbind

Click "Unbind" to:
- Delete the local sync repository
- Clear the encryption key and token saved in the keychain
- Reset the sync configuration

> The remote repository will not be deleted. To delete it, go to the Git service platform and do so manually.

## Sync Status

The Settings page displays the time and status of the last synchronization:

- **Success** (green) — The most recent sync completed normally
- **Failed** (red) — Displays the specific error message (e.g. network timeout, invalid token, etc.)
